# dotfiles

## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

### Using Git and the bootstrap script

You can clone the repository wherever you want. The `.config/dotfiles/bin/install.sh` script will copy the files to your home folder.

```bash
git clone https://<redacted>/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && .config/dotfiles/bin/install.sh
```

If there are any conflict with your current home files, it will do a git stash to them. Apply afterwards with `dotfiles stash pop`

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
git pull
dotfiles pull
```

### Specify the `$PATH`

If `~/.path` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files, before any feature testing (such as detecting which version of `ls` is being used) takes place.

Here’s an example `~/.path` file that adds `/usr/local/bin` to the `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Add custom commands without creating a new fork

If `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add a few custom commands without the need to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you don’t want to commit to a public repository.

You could also use `~/.extra` to override settings, functions and aliases from my dotfiles repository. It’s probably better to fork this repository instead, though.

### Install Homebrew formulae

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) formulae (and installing Homebrew, of course):

```bash
.config/macos/install-packages.sh
```

Some of the functionality of these dotfiles depends on formulae installed by `.config/macos/install-packages.sh`. If you don’t plan to run `.config/macos/install-packages.sh`, you should look carefully through the script and manually install any particularly important ones. A good example is Bash/Git completion: the dotfiles use a special version from Homebrew.

### Sensible macOS defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible macOS defaults:

```bash
.config/macos/settings.sh
```
